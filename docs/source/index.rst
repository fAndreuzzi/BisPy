Welcome to BisPy's documentation!
=================================

`BisPy <https://github.com/fAndreuzzi/BisPy>`_ is a Python library for the computation of the maximum bisimulation of directed graphs.

A brief introduction to bisimulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider a graph :math:`G = (V,E)`. A *bisimulation* :math:`\mathcal{B}` is a
binary relation on :math:`V` which satisfies the following condition:

.. math::

    (a,b) \in \mathcal{B} \implies \begin{cases}
        \forall a' \mid \langle a,a' \rangle \in E, \,\, \exists b' \mid \langle b,b' \rangle \in E \land (a',b') \in \mathcal{B}\\
        \forall b' \mid \langle b,b' \rangle \in E, \,\, \exists a' \mid \langle a,a' \rangle \in E \land (a',b') \in \mathcal{B}
    \end{cases}

The definition may be read as follows: given a pair of two nodes which are in
relation with respect to :math:`\mathcal{B}`, each child of the first node is
in relation with at least one child of the second node, and viceversa.

The following image shows an example of a bisimulation:

.. image:: _static/bisimulation_example.png

In the image an interesting property of bisimulation emerges: two
*bisimilar* nodes (namely two nodes in relation for at least one bisimulation
on the graph) *behave* in a similar way. This is equivalent to saying that all
their children behave in a similar way, which is exactly the condition stated
above. Let's look at another example:

.. image:: _static/bisimulation_example_2.png

Again, the two nodes are almost indistinguishable: we may switch :math:`a` and
:math:`b`, and apart from the name of the nodes nobody would notice. This is a
consequence of the fact (which can be proved) that two bisimilar nodes
represent the same set.

If you are convinced of the last statements, it is easy to understand that
the maximum bisimulation (namely the bisimulation which contains all
the bisimulations of the graph) tells a lot about the nodes of the graph and
how they behave. First of all, the maximum bisimulation is an equivalence
relation, therefore it divides the set of nodes in equivalence classes of
*bisimilar* nodes. Moreover, its equivalence classes are the maximal sets of
*bisimilar* nodes.

The bisimulation depicted in the first image, since nodes :math:`d,g` are
bisimilar, but are not in relation with respect to :math:`\mathcal{B}`. The
maximum bisimulation is in fact:

.. math::

  \mathcal{B}=\{(a),(b,c),(d,e,f,g)\}.

**Applications**

Maximum bisimulation may be used to find equivalent nodes (a task which has
a lot of applications in **concurrency theory** and **indexing** of
semi-structured datasets, for instance) or to minimize the graph (by collapsing
each equivalence class into a single node) while preserving the information
conveyed by the graph.

**Equivalence with RSCP**

It can be shown that finding the maximum bisimulation is equivalent to finding
the *Relational Stable Coarsest Partition* (RSCP) of the set :math:`V` with
respect to the relation :math:`E`. This problem consists in finding the
coarsest (i.e. the one with fewer blocks) **stable** partition of the set
:math:`V`, where stable means that for each couple of blocks :math:`B_1,B_2`
the following condition holds:

.. math::

    B_1 \subseteq E^{-1}(B_2) \lor B_1 \cap E^{-1}(B_2) = \emptyset.

This equivalence is widely exploited since the RSCP problem is easier to
express algorithmically.
